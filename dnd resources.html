            <p>Each combat round starts when the Player Characters (PC) initiate hostility or become attacked by a hostile creature. At the beginning of the combat round, the Dungeon Master(DM) will ask the PCs to roll Inititive. This roll determines what order combat takes place in.</p>
            <p>After the inititive order has been deterimined, the following steps can be taken when your turn comes around.
                <ul>

        <header>Bonus Action</header>
        <article>
            <p>Classes, spells, and other abilities allow you to take an additional action during your turn called a bonus action. You can only take a bonus action when the spell, ability, or feature states that you can do something as a bonus action. Otherwise, you have no bonus action.</p>
            <p>You can only take your bonus action on your turn, so you must chose which action to take if you have more than one available.</p>
            <p>You may not trade your action and bonus actions, and if a condition forces you to lose an action, you also lose your bonus action.</p>
            <p><h3>Homebrew rules:</h3></p>
            <p>To improve combat flow, use of multiple spells for casters, and improve fun of the game, the following rules are used in some homebrew games.</p>
            <p>Health potions may be used as bonus actions ONLY when taken by self. You may not use a bonus action to heal party member with a health pot.</p>

            <p>Wnat to punch a bad guy? Swing your mace of justice? Cut the head of the dragon clean off with your great axe? Melee battle is your bread and butter.</p>
            <p>To hit your opponent, swing your weapon and if you pierce the armor of the enemy, your hit will be sucessful.</p>
            <p><h3>When using a melee weapon:</h3></p>
            <p>Roll a d20</p>
            <p>Add your Strength modifier</p>
            <p>Then add your profcinceny bonus</p>
            <p>And finally, add any bonus from feats, skills, or weapon bonus. If this number is higher than your opponents armor class, roll damage.</p>
            <p><h3>To roll damage:</h3></p>
            <p>Roll your weapon's damage die. Those may vary by weapon (1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12).</p>
            <p>Add your Strength modifier</p>
            <p>Finally, add any bonus from skill, feat, or weapon (e.g 1d8+2, the bonus would be the +2). </p>
            <p>If you are wielding two weapons, or fighting unarmed, you are able to use your bonus action to perform an attack with your offhand. To attack with your offhand, roll an attack without any attack bonus other than your STR modifier.</p>
            <p>Some classes or feats will allow the player to use finesse weapons. These weapons use the Dexterity modifier. So when using a finesse weapon, add your dex modifier instead of strength.</p>
            <p>You can also attack unarmed. If you do, just roll a normal attack. If successful, add 1 + your strength modifier. You are proficient attacking unarmed. Attacking with an object found on the ground is a possibility as well. Such as a chair leg, candle holder, or any other improvised weapon. When doing so, roll an attack without any profincencies, because it is not something you wield normally.</p>

            <p>To hit your opponent, pull your bowstring or throw your weapon and if you pierce the armor of the enemy, your hit will be sucessful.</p>
            <p><h3>When using a ranged weapon:</h3></p>
            <p>Roll a d20</p>

            <p>Range on your weapon is factor in your attacking. A weapon will have a range detailed next to it. The first number, is your normal range. the distance from zero to that number is your perfered distance to strike. From the first number to the second number, shots come at a disadvantage. The third range, is an automatic failure. </p>

        <header>Spellcasting</header>
        <article>
            <p>A spell is a magical effect, a changing of fates, or even the creation of creatures. In casting a spell,  the character must dig deep into the knowledge curated throughout life. These energies, threads of essence that coalesce around and create the spell the caster is preparing to use. </p>
            <p><h3>Spell Level</h3></p>
            <p>These spells are listed on a tiered level system. Starting at level 0, going up to level 9. Level 0, are known as cantrips. . As the level of the spell goes up, the effect on the spell gets larger and more damaging at times.
            <p><h3>Known and Prepared spells</h3></p>
            <p>Before casting a spell, the spell caster must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or have access to an item enchanted with a spell. The same is true for monsters and enemies that use mamge. Some spell casters such as clerics and wizards have to undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies from calss to class. In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any time depends on the character's level. </p>
            <p>Classes like wizard, scorcorer, and warlocks only have the knowledge of a certain amount of spells. Whether in their mind, or their spell book, these spells can only be changed at times stated in the PHB. Warlocks, for example, can change known spells when they level up. Wizards,have to consult their library of magical knowledge once a day and can swap prepared spells. However, these classes only have a limited ammount of spells known.</p>
            <p>Druids and clerics have been endowed with the ability to know all spells known to their class. However, once a long rest, they too have to set up a list of prepared spells in mind to use throughout the day. While the magical essence infusing clerics and druids allow them to know all spells known to their respective class spell lists, they will only know spells studided or encountered in their lives.</p>
            <p><h3>Spell Slots</h3></p>
            <p>Manipulating the energy and fabric of essences that is magic can be physcially and mentally taxing on the spellcaster, and higher level spells even more so. In each class section in the PHB there is a table that lists how many spell slots a caster can have at each level. For example, a 3rd level wizrd will have four 1st level slots, and two 2nd level slots. </p>
            <p>When a spell gets cast, the spell expends a slot of that spells level, or higher, "filling" the slot with that spell.</p>
            <p>Finishing a long rest restores all spell slots.</p>
            <p>Some characters and monsters have abilites to allow them to cast spells without using spell slots. Those exemptions will be explained on the respective class discriptions.</p>
            <p><h3>Casting Higher Level Spells</h3></p>
            <p>A spell can be cast at a higher level for a larger effect, however, spells CANNOT be cast at a lower level. If a all of your 1st level slots are expended, you can cast at a 2nd level. However, that cannot happen if all of your 2nd level slots are filled. A 2nd level spell cannot be cast at 1st level.</p>
            <p>Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p>
            <p>Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful effects at higher levels, detailed in the PHB.</p>
            <p><h3>Cantrips</h3></p>
            <p>A cangrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot, and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind, and has infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect multiple times over. A cantrip is spell level 0.</p>
            <p><h3>Rituals</h3></p>
            <p>Certain spells have a special tag: Ritual. Such spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of the spell takes 10 minutes longer than normal. Ritual spell casting also keeps spells slots intact and does not expend them. However, this means a spell cannot be cast at a higher level if casted as a ritual.</p>
            <p>To cast a spell as a ritual, the spell caster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. Druids and clerics for example have such feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared on their list of spells known, unless specified otherwize, such as a wizard does.</p>
            <p><h3>Components</h3></p>
            <p>A spell may require physical, verbal, or movement requirements. Iin order to cast the spell, you must make sure that you follow the three componants used, Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M). If you cannot provide any of the requirements used by the spell, then the spell cannot be cast.
            <p><b>Verbal (V)</b></p>
            <p>Most spells require the chants of an encantation or a mystic phrase. The words themselves are not the source of the power; rather, the combination of sounds, pitches, timbres, set the mystic threads in alignment. Thus, a character or creature who is gaged, unconscious, or in an area of scilence such as a silent spell, cannot cast spells with a verbal componant. </p>
            <p><b>Somatic (S)</b></p>
            <p>Spellcasting may include a forceful or intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have a free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. </p>
            <p><b>Material (M)</b></p>
            <p>Casting spells may require a particular object, stated in the description of the spell. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of the componant specified for the spell. But if a cost is indicated for a componant, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p>
            <p><h3>Duration</h3></p>
            <p>A spells duration is the length of time the spell persists or lasts. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, house, or even years. Some spells state that their effects last until the spell is dispelled or destroyed.</p>
            <p><b>Instantaneous</b></p>
            <p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that it cannot be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p>
            <p><b>Concentration</b></p>
            <p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, the spell ends.</p>
            <p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, it is stated in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end the concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
            <p>Normal activiy, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>
           <p><ul>
            <li><b>- Casting anther spell that requires concentration.</b>You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You cannot concentrate on two spells at once.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>- Taking damage.</b> Whenever you take damage while concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. The DC equals 10 or half of the damage you take, whatever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a fireball, you make a seperate saving throw for each source of damage.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>- Being incapacitated or killed. </b>You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li></p></ul>
            <p><h3>Areas of Effect</h3></p>
            <p>Some spells cover an area allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p>
            <p>A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>
            <p><b>Cone</b></p>
            <p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p>
            <p><b>Cube</b></p>
            <p>You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
            <p><b>Cylinder</b></p>
            <p>You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outwards from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from that point. A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's AoE.</p>
            <p><h3>Spellcasting Saving Throws</h3></p>
            <p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spells effect or damage. The spell specifies what ability is used and any effect that occurs on success or failure.</p>
            <p>The DC (Difficulty class) to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. </p>
            <p><h3>Homebrew Rules</h3></p>
            <p>In large groups, to speed up combat and increase the action, more than one spell can be cast per round.</p>
            <p>If a spell is cast at a higher level, a second spell can be cast as long as it is below level two. Both spells must follow the actioin/bonus action requirements. If a caster does not have any spell slots availabile lower than a spell cast, a second spell cannot be cast. </p>
            <p>For example. If a 5th level spell is cast as an action, any bonus action spell level 2, level 1, or a cantrip can be cast. </p>

            <p>unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such cure wounds spell or a healing potion can remove damage in an instant.</p>
            <p>When a creature recieves healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit points maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. There are various ways to heal, short rest, long rest, magical healing, and non magical healing.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li><b>Short Rest</b> - you can spend hit dice and get back health. This is a sort of battle field patch up</li>
                <li><b>Long Rest</b> - This is a full nights sleep. Restores all health points, and various other benifits.</li>
                <li><b>Magical Healing</b> - Spells, potions, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Non-magical Healing</b>> - Healer's kit type of healing.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>A creature that has died cannot regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.</p>
            <p><h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3></p>
            <p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to - hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit points maximum. </p>
            <p><h3>Falling Unconscious</h3></p>
            if damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.
            <p><h3>Homebrew rules</h3></p>
            <p>Health potions may be used on a bonus action if taken by self. If a potion is given to another, that causes a full action as normal.</p>

            <p>Certain special abilites, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occure on your turn or someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.</p>
            <p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>

        <header>Saving Throws</header>
        <article>
            <p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
            <p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>
            <p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two Saving Throws. The Wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her Proficiency Bonus to Saving Throws made using a particular ability score. Some Monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
            <p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s Spellcasting ability and Proficiency Bonus.</p>
            <p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>

            <p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and Training in an effort to overcome a Challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>
            <p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six Abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most Common DCs.</p>
            <p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the Challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p>
